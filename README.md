Pharmacy Inventory Management System

Overview

As the lead developer of this project, I've built a comprehensive Pharmacy Inventory Management System that enables centralized tracking of inventory across multiple pharmacy locations. This full-stack application features:

React frontend with TypeScript for type safety

FastAPI backend with Python

SQLite database (easily upgradable to PostgreSQL/MySQL)

Modern UI with responsive design

Complete CRUD operations for pharmacies and inventory

Key Features Implemented
Frontend Architecture
Created a multi-page application with React Router

Developed reusable, type-safe components

Implemented clean state management with React hooks

Designed intuitive UI with CSS modules

Added comprehensive error handling and loading states

Backend Services
Built RESTful API endpoints with FastAPI

Implemented proper data validation with Pydantic models

Configured CORS for secure frontend-backend communication

Structured database models with SQLAlchemy ORM

Added centralized error handling

Database Design
Created relational schema for pharmacies and inventory

Established proper foreign key relationships

Implemented automatic table creation/migrations

Added sample data initialization endpoint

Developer Notes
During development, I focused on:

Type Safety: Implemented thorough TypeScript interfaces and Pydantic models to catch errors at compile time.

Performance: Optimized database queries and implemented proper loading states.

Maintainability:

Structured code with clear separation of concerns

Added comprehensive documentation

Implemented consistent code style

User Experience:

Designed intuitive navigation flows

Added clear feedback for user actions

Implemented responsive layouts

Future Enhancements
Authentication: Add JWT-based auth for pharmacy staff

Advanced Reporting: Implement data analytics dashboard

Real-time Updates: Add WebSocket support for live inventory tracking

Mobile App: React Native version for on-the-go access
